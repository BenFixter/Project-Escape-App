We talked about redecorating it into one of our themed escape rooms, but we felt an uneasy presence so decided to leave everything where it was.\n\n That is until now when we've decided to open the doors and let the people uncover the attic's secrets for themselves.\n\n Will you Escape the Cursed Attic?",
